<h2>BTV-GLUE</h2>

<p>
Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a vector-borne virus within the Orbivirus genus of the Reoviridae family. It causes the bluetongue disease in various common domestic ruminant and wild animal species;
an outbreak starting in 2006 threatened livestock industries in northern Europe.

In this database, a collaboration between the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/iii/cvr/">MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research</a> 
and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pirbright.ac.uk">The Pirbright Institute</a>,
we have collated several thousand BTV sequences from the literature and added 
complementary context data alongside each sequence. 
</p>
<p>
The virus has a segmented genome and reassortment of the 10 segments has been observed. 
The segments encoding the capsid proteins have a complex evolutionary history;
more than 20 different serotypes are in circulation, which complicates ongoing surveillance and vaccine programmes. 

Each of BTV's 10 segments is allocated a separate phylogenetic data structure within database. 
Each sequence is held within a multiple sequence alignment specific to the segment and clade. Reference sequences 
with genome feature annotations are defined for each segment clade.

This will help accurately capture the ongoing evolution and 
epidemiology of the virus, whilst also allowing study of reassortment and other phenomena.
