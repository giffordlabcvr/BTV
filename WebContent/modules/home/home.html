		<h4>A Genome Sequence Data Resource for Bluetongue Virus</h4>
<p>
Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a vector-borne virus within the Orbivirus genus of the Reoviridae family. It causes the bluetongue disease in various common domestic ruminant and wild animal species;
an outbreak starting in 2006 threatened livestock industries in northern Europe. 
</p>
		<p>The virus has a segmented genome and reassortment of the 10
			segments has been observed. The segments encoding the capsid proteins
			have a complex evolutionary history; more than 20 different serotypes
			are in circulation, which complicates ongoing surveillance and
			vaccine programmes. 
			
			
			<!-- Each of BTV's 10 segments is allocated a separate
			phylogenetic data structure within database. Each sequence is held
			within a multiple sequence alignment specific to the segment and
			clade. Reference sequences with genome feature annotations are
			defined for each segment clade. This will help accurately capture the
			ongoing evolution and epidemiology of the virus, whilst also allowing
			study of reassortment and other phenomena. -->
		
		<p>
		
		<p>The web version of BTV-GLUE can be used for basic analysis. An
			offline version of the resource (in preparation) can be installed by bioinformaticians
			and used for more advanced work.</p>
